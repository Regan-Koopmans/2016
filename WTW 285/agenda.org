*** TODO : Task 1

**** TODO : Understand the problem.

For this task I have to add a 1px black border to an image.
In order to to this I will likely have to traverse the whole
binary file, and based on the location of the pixel, set
its value to black.

What I need to know:

- The information contained in a bitmap pixel. (perhaps find
a useful struct defined in c to determine fields)


                  ################
                  #              #
                  #  some image  #
                  #              #
                  ################

The critical sections that need to be changed:

- If the pixel is in the first row (0,y)
- If the pixel is in the last row (0,max)
- If the pixel is in the left column (0,y)
- If the pixel is in the right column (max,y)
